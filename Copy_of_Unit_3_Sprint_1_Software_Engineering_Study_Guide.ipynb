        "1. What is OOP?\n",
        "```\n",
        "Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs using the idea of \"objects\" to represent data and methods as opposed to just lists of instructions to the computer, telling the computer to do certain things in a certain way, which is called procedural programming.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an object?\n",
        "```\n",
        "Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them.  An object is an instance of a class\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a class?\n",
        "```\n",
        "A class is a code template for creating objects.  Objects are created using the contructors defined in the class\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is inheritance?\n",
        "```\n",
        "Inheritance is the mechanism of deriving new classes from existing ones. This  allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, and this makes it possible that a class created through inheritance inherites the attributes and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What does it mean to \"instantiate an object\"?\n",
        "```\n",
        "The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object.\n",
        "When a class defines an __init__() method, class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance thereby causing the new object to inheret the atributes of the parent class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a dunder method (aka magic method)? What dunder method is called when you instantiate an object?\n",
        "```\n",
        "Dunder methods are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. A dunder method allows instances of your classes to behave as if they were functions, so that you can \"call\" them, pass them to functions that take functions as arguments, and so on.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the super method and when is it used?\n",
        "```\n",
        "Super method is a built-in function that returns the proxy object that allows you to refer parent class by 'super. ' The super function in Python can be used to gain access to inherited methods, which is either from the parent or sibling class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are two other programming paradigms?\n",
